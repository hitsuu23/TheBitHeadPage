                <h1>Learn C/C++ to Become a Hacker</h1>
                <p>The first step in learning to become a hacker is learning C/C++. C/C++ will teach you how to program and understand what's going on at a low level. Once you master these languages, every other language becomes more accessible due to their low-level nature. With AI taking over, knowing the syntax of a language is less important. What matters is understanding what each line of code does down to the register.</p>
                <p>All that is important is that you know what each line of code is doing down to the register. Programming gives you the tools to understand the computer. Skipping learning to program is like trying to learn a new language without attempting to speak it. Anyone that tells you differently that you need programming knowledge in cyber security is setting you to fail. Sure, you don't need to know the WIN32 API to get a 15/H help desk job, but that's not what we want. We want a six-figure job. Right?</p>
